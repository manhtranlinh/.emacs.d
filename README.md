My Emacs config.

Some parts are reusable, but most of them are highly customized and hard to use out-of-the-box.

Emacs configs are supposed to be read for inspiration and ideas anyway, not used as-is.
Adapt Emacs to your personal self, not the other way around.

**Highlights:**
- Extensive use of variable-width font (for non-code texts) to improve readability.
- Custom fontset for multi-lingual texts.
- Obsessively home-grown color theme.
- Heavily tweaked key bindings for Dvorak layout, with a focus on ergonomics and consistency with other (non-Emacs) parts of the system (handled by Karabiner/AutoKey).
- Some Vim navigation/editing through `evil`.
- Reproducible and hackable package management with `straight.el`.
