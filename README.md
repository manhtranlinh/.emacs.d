My Emacs config

Some parts are reusable, but highly customized and hard to use out-of-the-box.

**Highlights:**
- Extensive use of variable-width font (for non-code texts) to improve readability.
- Custom fontset for multi-lingual texts.
- Obsessively home-grown color theme.
- Some Vim navigation/editing through `evil`.
- Heavily tweaked key bindings for Dvorak layout.
